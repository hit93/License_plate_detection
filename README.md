# License plate detection using YOLO

This repository demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 for training a model on a car license plate detection dataset. It includes code for training, analyzing training metrics such as losses and mAP, and visualizing results.

## What is YOLO?

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. It predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in a single evaluation, making it exceptionally fast and efficient.

### Advantages of YOLO
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy, suitable for applications requiring real-time object detection.
- **Single-Pass Detection**: YOLO processes the entire image in one pass, reducing computational overhead.
- **Generalization**: Performs well across various datasets and environments.

### Whatâ€™s New in YOLOv8?
- **Improved Architectures**: Enhanced backbone and neck designs for better feature extraction and fusion.
- **Task-Specific Models**: Separate models for detection, segmentation, and classification tasks.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified APIs for training and deploying models.
- **Better Performance**: Higher mAP and lower latency compared to earlier versions.

### Table summarizing each loss and metric
| **Name**                 | **Explanation**                                                                                       | **Objective**                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **`train/box_loss`**     | Measures the error in predicted bounding box coordinates relative to ground truth (e.g., IoU loss).   | Improve bounding box accuracy.                   |
| **`train/cls_loss`**     | Measures the error in classifying the object inside a bounding box.                                   | Improve classification accuracy.                 |
| **`train/dfl_loss`**     | Distribution Focal Loss; improves bounding box regression by modeling coordinate distributions.       | Enhance precision in bounding box localization.  |
| **`metrics/precision(B)`** | Precision: Fraction of correct positive detections out of all predicted positives.                   | Avoid false positives.                           |
| **`metrics/recall(B)`**  | Recall: Fraction of correct positive detections out of all actual positives.                         | Avoid missing objects (false negatives).         |
| **`metrics/mAP50(B)`**   | Mean Average Precision at 50% IoU threshold.                                                        | Measure detection accuracy at standard IoU.      |
| **`metrics/mAP50-95(B)`**| Mean Average Precision averaged across IoU thresholds (50%-95%, step 5%).                            | Measure comprehensive detection accuracy.        |
